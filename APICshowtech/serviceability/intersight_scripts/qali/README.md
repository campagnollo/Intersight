Use this repo to track unit tests that we won't be commiting to the intersight qa_tests repo. 
The tests living here can easily be shared, worked on, and debugged collaboratively.

The files demo-intersight-admin-key.pem and demo_db.py needs to be added to ~/.qali/topology to make the test operational.
